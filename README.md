# Program-Flow-And-Control-Box-Filling-Algorithm
The purpose of this project is to write a code in C++ that can take input from the user and pass it to the different function. This is achieved by implementing box filling algorithm in this project. The task is to decide how many number of boxes are required to carry the parts. There are four different size of boxes available and each of them has different filling capacity. Moreover, largest box should carry highest number of parts and second largest box should carry second highest number of parts and so on. This program will take number of parts to be carried as a input and give number of required boxes as a output. Moreover, the program will also reject input if it is negative or in fraction. Please note that the purpose of this project is to get familiar with the functions and loops and hence OOP is not used. It is strongly recommanded to use OOP for data encapsulation.
